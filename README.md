# loto_simulation
This Python program simulates a simple lottery-like game where users get three attempts to guess a number from a predefined list. The program provides feedback for correct and incorrect guesses and handles invalid input gracefully. It's a beginner-friendly demonstration of user input handling, error handling, and simple game logic.
